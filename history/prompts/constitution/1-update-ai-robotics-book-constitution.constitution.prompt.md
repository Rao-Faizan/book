## Prompt

/sp.constitution
Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation
1. Core Principles

These principles define the philosophy and rules that govern the entire book-creation process:

1.1 Accuracy & Verification

Every factual statement must be validated using reliable, original, or authoritative sources.

AI-generated content must be checked manually for correctness before inclusion.

1.2 Clarity for a Mixed Technical Audience

Book content must be understandable to:

Beginner-to-intermediate developers

Computer science students

AI/LLM enthusiasts

Jargon must be defined before use.

Complex topics should include diagrams, examples, and explanations.

1.3 Reproducibility

All tutorials, code samples, workflows, and instructions must be testable and reproducible.

Steps must be written in a deterministic way so readers can follow without ambiguity.

1.4 Rigor

Claims must be supported by:

Technical documentation

Official research papers

RFCs, Standards

Peer-reviewed sources (preferred)

Avoid marketing material or unverified blog claims unless cross-checked.

2. Key Standards
2.1 Source Requirements

Minimum 40% peer-reviewed or formal academic/industry papers.

Remaining sources may include:

Official documentation (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.)

Books, technical blogs, GitHub repositories

Conference talks or whitepapers

2.2 Citation Style

Citation format: APA 7th Edition

All diagrams and images must include:

Attribution

Source link (if required)

2.3 Zero-Tolerance Plagiarism Policy

No paragraph may be copied without proper citation.

All content must pass plagiarism checks using:

Turnitin

GPTZero

Grammarly plagiarism checker
(You may choose any.)

2.4 AI Content Handling

All AI-generated text must be:

Edited

Verified

Human-approved

Any content generated by AI must be consistently checked against hallucinations and misinformation.

2.5 Writing Quality & Readability

Maintain a Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level of 9–12.

Sentences must be concise, active voice, and clear.

Each chapter should have:

Key takeaways

Summary

Examples

3. Constraints
3.1 Book Length

Total word count: 10,000 – 25,000 words
(A full book, not a paper.)

3.2 Technical Format

Output format:

Markdown (MDX) for Docusaurus

Web-optimized

GitHub Pages compatible

Include:

Code snippets

Images/diagrams

Tables

API examples

3.3 Project Tools

Must use:

Spec-Kit Plus for structured writing

Claude Code for local AI-assisted development

Docusaurus for book website

GitHub Pages for deployment

4. Success Criteria
4.1 Accuracy

All claims are cross-checked against at least one source.

All code examples run successfully in a test environment.

4.2 Quality

Zero plagiarism detected before final publication.

Readers can reproduce all steps independently.

4.3 Completeness

Book must cover:

AI Concepts

LLMs

Prompt engineering

Spec-driven development

Book-writing workflow using AI

Docusaurus site creation

GitHub Pages deployment

4.4 Technical Review

Final manuscript must pass:

Peer review by at least 2 technical reviewers

Fact-checking audit

Build test (Docusaurus build without errors)

4.5 Deployment

Book must be:

Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages

Navigable, responsive, and readable

Documented in a README with setup instructions

5. Deliverables

Complete book in Docusaurus MDX format

GitHub repository with:

Source code

Book files

Deployment configuration

Final PDF export with embedded citations

Changelog documenting writing progress

Architecture diagram of book workflow

6. Versioning & Update Policy

Each chapter must include:

Version number

Last updated timestamp

Updates follow a semantic versioning approach:

MAJOR – major content restructure

MINOR – new sections, diagrams, code

PATCH – typo fixes, small edits

## Response snapshot

The project constitution for "AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation" has been successfully updated to version 1.0.0. The constitution defines core principles, key standards, constraints, success criteria, deliverables, and versioning policy for the book creation process. The document is located at .specify/memory/constitution.md.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully updated project constitution with user-provided content.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run for constitution update.
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Review templates and update if necessary, then proceed with feature specification.
- 🧠 Reflection: Initial constitution successfully created based on user input. Need to propagate changes to other templates.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
