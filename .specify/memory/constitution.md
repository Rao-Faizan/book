# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1.1 Accuracy & Verification
Every factual statement must be validated using reliable, original, or authoritative sources.
AI-generated content must be checked manually for correctness before inclusion.

### 1.2 Clarity for a Mixed Technical Audience
Book content must be understandable to:
- Beginner-to-intermediate developers
- Computer science students
- AI/LLM enthusiasts
Jargon must be defined before use.
Complex topics should include diagrams, examples, and explanations.

### 1.3 Reproducibility
All tutorials, code samples, workflows, and instructions must be testable and reproducible.
Steps must be written in a deterministic way so readers can follow without ambiguity.

### 1.4 Rigor
Claims must be supported by:
- Technical documentation
- Official research papers
- RFCs, Standards
- Peer-reviewed sources (preferred)
Avoid marketing material or unverified blog claims unless cross-checked.

## Key Standards
### 2.1 Source Requirements
Minimum 40% peer-reviewed or formal academic/industry papers.
Remaining sources may include:
- Official documentation (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.)
- Books, technical blogs, GitHub repositories
- Conference talks or whitepapers

### 2.2 Citation Style
Citation format: APA 7th Edition
All diagrams and images must include:
- Attribution
- Source link (if required)

### 2.3 Zero-Tolerance Plagiarism Policy
No paragraph may be copied without proper citation.
All content must pass plagiarism checks using:
- Turnitin
- GPTZero
- Grammarly plagiarism checker
(You may choose any.)

### 2.4 AI Content Handling
All AI-generated text must be:
- Edited
- Verified
- Human-approved
Any content generated by AI must be consistently checked against hallucinations and misinformation.

### 2.5 Writing Quality & Readability
Maintain a Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level of 9–12.
Sentences must be concise, active voice, and clear.
Each chapter should have:
- Key takeaways
- Summary
- Examples

## Constraints
### 3.1 Book Length
Total word count: 10,000 – 25,000 words
(A full book, not a paper.)

### 3.2 Technical Format
Output format:
- Markdown (MDX) for Docusaurus
- Web-optimized
- GitHub Pages compatible
Include:
- Code snippets
- Images/diagrams
- Tables
- API examples

### 3.3 Project Tools
Must use:
- Spec-Kit Plus for structured writing
- Claude Code for local AI-assisted development
- Docusaurus for book website
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Success Criteria
### 4.1 Accuracy
All claims are cross-checked against at least one source.
All code examples run successfully in a test environment.

### 4.2 Quality
Zero plagiarism detected before final publication.
Readers can reproduce all steps independently.

### 4.3 Completeness
Book must cover:
- AI Concepts
- LLMs
- Prompt engineering
- Spec-driven development
- Book-writing workflow using AI
- Docusaurus site creation
- GitHub Pages deployment

### 4.4 Technical Review
Final manuscript must pass:
- Peer review by at least 2 technical reviewers
- Fact-checking audit
- Build test (Docusaurus build without errors)

### 4.5 Deployment
Book must be:
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages
- Navigable, responsive, and readable
- Documented in a README with setup instructions

## Deliverables

Complete book in Docusaurus MDX format
GitHub repository with:
- Source code
- Book files
- Deployment configuration
Final PDF export with embedded citations
Changelog documenting writing progress
Architecture diagram of book workflow

## Versioning & Update Policy

Each chapter must include:
- Version number
- Last updated timestamp
Updates follow a semantic versioning approach:
- MAJOR – major content restructure
- MINOR – new sections, diagrams, code
- PATCH – typo fixes, small edits
